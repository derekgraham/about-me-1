    <h2>About George</h1>
      <p>
      I was born and raised in Seattle, WA. I am married to my <br>
      highschool sweetheart, Kelly. Our 4th wedding anniversary <br>
      is coming up on June 31st, 2016. We have 3 cats named Ophelia, Mo <br>
      and Potato. After studying philosophy in college and working for years<br>
      as a server, barista and bartender I am making the switch to a career<br>
      in coding. I'm not certain what path that will take, but I am very<br>
      excited about the possibilities.
